## ▶ EDITOR-ERRORS TRACK — CLOSED 2026-08-22 (D743)

Drawer covered the fold in every template editor; several blocks errored. Three unrelated
causes, all closed — **full detail in D743, do not restate here**: the drawer shell was
exactly `100dvh` (now a 46px strip + a preview toggle); six validation errors from comments
inside `sgs/container`/`sgs/tab` inner content (**dynamic ≠ unvalidated**), 0 bad / 20
surfaces; and `check-undeclared-attrs.py` read JSX tags before stripping comments — 17 false
findings, fixed on `main` (`1693918f`), it had broken every build.

⚠ **Not ours:** the canary intermittently 500s (`Error establishing a database connection`)
under the ~12 concurrent block-renderer calls a template load fires, producing phantom
"Error loading block" banners that vanish on reload. Infrastructure — don't chase it.
