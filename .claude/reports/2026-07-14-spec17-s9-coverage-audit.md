date: 2026-07-14
decision: D328

purpose: Bean's hard gate — confirm every §S9 FR is built + live-verified BEFORE Spec 33 Part 2

# Spec 17 §S9 coverage audit — FR-S9-1 … FR-S9-11

**Bottom line (updated D330, 2026-07-14):** **10 of 11 FRs are DONE + live-verified. ONE remains — FR-S9-8 (per-device content adaptation).** FR-S9-9 (3 header behaviours as no-code block controls) SHIPPED + live-verified this session (D330, commit `7a054e11`) — including retiring the parallel theme-side header-mode system so the plugin body-class layer is the one home. FR-S9-10 (Site Info set-once-renders-both) live-CONFIRMED (D330, commit `ba21fccf`). **Spec 17 §S9 is NOT yet "totally covered" — FR-S9-8 is the single remaining build** (its own `/strategic-plan` next session); after it lands + live-verifies, Bean's "totally covered" sign-off gates Spec 33 Part 2.

Each row states status against the LIVE build (verified in code + on the sandybrown canary), not the spec's own claims.

| FR | What it requires | Status | Evidence |
|----|------------------|--------|----------|
| **FR-S9-1** | Rule evolution — specialised `site-*` container blocks permitted inside template parts | ✅ **DONE** | `no-header-footer-block.py` regex permits `site-header`/`site-footer`/`adaptive-nav` by construction (no-op verified D323/D327) |
| **FR-S9-2** | `sgs/site-header` (3 named rows, typed palette, empty-row-zero-output) | ✅ **DONE** | Live D324; section-KIND, delegates to `SGS_Container_Wrapper` |
| **FR-S9-3** | `sgs/site-footer` (rows + up to 6 columns + bottom bar) | ✅ **DONE** | Live D325 |
| **FR-S9-4** | `sgs/adaptive-nav` (one menu, 4-tier collapse, mega-menu, overflow auto-collapse) | ✅ **DONE** | Live D326; replaces `core/navigation` → kills the WC Block-Hooks injection |
| **FR-S9-5** | `sgs/mobile-nav` drawer P0 fix + GOV.UK-grade a11y contract | ✅ **DONE** | P0 unclickable-drawer fix live-verified D323 (re-parented to `<body>`) |
| **FR-S9-6** | Per-breakpoint `{desktop,tablet,mobile}` override model (all overridable props) | ✅ **DONE (this session, D328)** | Engine D327; box/width/link-font-size closed D328. Live-verified 1440/375 per tier + per-side inherit; 34 unit tests; qc-council-gated |
| **FR-S9-7** | Never-overflow Cluster + `clamp()` layout | ✅ **DONE** | `scrollWidth ≤ innerWidth` at 320-1440 live-verified (D324 + re-confirmed every measure this session) |
| **FR-S9-8** | Per-device content adaptation (visibility toggle, `showLabel`/`iconOnly`, move-to-drawer, Indus pattern) | ⚠️ **OPEN (partial)** | Universal `device-visibility.php` extension EXISTS (per-tier show/hide). **NOT built:** `showLabel`/`iconOnly` with working `mailto:`/`tel:`, the move-to-drawer drop-zone, the Indus slim-bar reference pattern. |
| **FR-S9-9** | 3 header behaviours (sticky + transparent-on-scroll + shrink) as SITE-EDITOR block-inspector controls (D329, Bean added shrink) | ✅ **DONE + LIVE (D330, `7a054e11`)** | Independent no-code toggles on the `sgs/site-header` inspector (`headerSticky`/`headerTransparent`/`headerShrink` + `contrastSafe`), bridged to the plugin body-class layer via `resolve_active_header_behaviour()` (reads block attrs off the active header part). qc-council-gated (NO-GO→corrected: scroll-driven shrink, scrim/force-solid WCAG modes, own `is-header-shrunk` class). Live-verified all 3 + scrim on sandybrown; **the parallel theme-side header-mode system was RETIRED** (Task 2b — files deleted, single `--sgs-header-height` publisher, one home). |
| **FR-S9-10** | Global style defaults + shared Site Info access across header AND footer | ✅ **DONE + LIVE-CONFIRMED (D330, `ba21fccf`)** | A `phone` set ONCE in `sgs_site_info` renders in BOTH the header (business-info added to the header top row) AND footer live on sandybrown + the Org schema; 3 blocks literal-free (token-with-fallback). No new store/binding/admin page. Caveat: ≥2-client universality is by-construction (no live indus deployment exists; client-agnostic blocks + per-site store/tokens). |
| **FR-S9-11** | CPT `template` swap + DB reseed (+ Part-2 integration-points doc only) | ✅ **DONE (for §S9 scope)** | Both CPT templates present: `sgs_header`→`sgs/site-header`, `sgs_footer`→`sgs/site-footer` (`class-sgs-block-cpts.php` L133/L161); DB reseeded via `/sgs-update` D328. Step 3 (cloning-pipeline Part 2) is the explicitly-deferred follow-on = **Spec 33 Part 2**. |

## The 1 remaining open build (needs its own /strategic-plan + /phase-planner + live-verify)

1. **FR-S9-8 — per-device content adaptation.** Add per-tier visibility (extend/reuse `device-visibility.php`), `showLabel`/`iconOnly` booleans on nav/CTA/contact elements (`iconOnly` email→`mailto:`, phone→`tel:`), a move-to-drawer drop-zone (item renders only inside `sgs/mobile-nav` at the collapsed tier), and reproduce the Indus slim-bar reference pattern. Verify on Indus AND Mama's (R-31-9).

**CLOSED this session (D330):** FR-S9-9 (3 header behaviours, `7a054e11`) + FR-S9-10 (Site Info set-once, `ba21fccf`).

## Related finding (block-quality, out of §S9 scope but surfaced D328)
The shared `SGS_Container_Wrapper` has **no `style.border` emission** (grep = 0). These blocks declare `__experimentalBorder` with `SkipSerialization`, so their borders (e.g. the footer bottom-bar 1px divider) never render. A universal wrapper-border-emit is a block-quality follow-up (affects every wrapper block that sets a border, not just §S9).

## Gate decision for Bean
Spec 17 §S9 is **10/11 covered** (D330). **FR-S9-8 (per-device content adaptation) is the SINGLE remaining build** before "totally covered". Recommend one focused session with its own `/strategic-plan` (new drop-zone + `showLabel`/`iconOnly` on business-info + adaptive-nav + the Indus slim-bar pattern). Once FR-S9-8 lands + live-verifies on ≥2 clients, Bean's "totally covered" sign-off gates Spec 33 Part 2. FR-S9-11's Part-2 plumbing IS Spec 33 Part 2 itself, correctly sequenced after this gate.
