# Indus delivery, Session S (sign-off)

Context: every Indus surface is built and accessible. This session produces the evidence for Bean's sign-off and runs one fix round (Spec 48 Appendix B step 25).

Read first: `.claude/plans/2026-10-21-indus-delivery.md` in full (it is the approved plan for its units; you need no separate plan-mode approval), then `.claude/LEDGER.md`'s Indus front. Before touching a surface, read the governing spec section the plan names (Spec 48 `.claude/specs/48-CLONING-SYSTEM.md`, Spec 38 and 38A for motion, Spec 04 for forms, Spec 01 and 36 for the logo and SVG upload); grep large specs to the FR, never read them whole.

## Tasks, in order
1. U18: the check on every surface; cropped draft-and-live pairs for every surface at 375, 768 and 1440 (the header also at its thresholds); `gaps.json` written with every gate's evidence and every accepted difference naming its rule.
2. Bean's eye (about 1 h with the pairs): show him surface by surface, collect his rulings in one pass, then one fix round.
3. The carried content questions (the plan's "Also owned here", bullet "Content for Bean at sign-off"): put them to Bean in the same sitting, each self-contained, including L-06 and L-09 (the square logo's letters are one path in the asset, so they cannot wave); flip those two keys per his answer.

## Skills
- `/autopilot` first (routing, orchestration, docs current).
- `/delegate` before each subagent dispatch (model and effort); `/subagent-prompt` to write the brief; `/dispatching-parallel-agents` for at most three at once.
- `/systematic-debugging` the moment anything fails unexpectedly (prove the cause before the fix).
- `/migration-method` before the 4th file getting the same change (detector first).
- `/qc-council` on the session's work before `/handoff`, which closes the session.
- `/visual-qa`, `/sgs-clone`; `/handoff` closes the delivery (archive the plan once every key is done or accepted).

## Tools
| Tool | Use it for |
|---|---|
| `/sgs-db`, `python ~/.claude/hooks/wp-blocks.py` (`schema`, `attrs`) | what a block's settings are and do, before claiming anything is missing or built (framework DB, read-only) |
| `node scripts/computed-route/capabilities.mjs --like <id>` / `--drafts` / `--gate` | worked examples for a gap, the open gap list, the coverage gate |
| `node scripts/computed-route/delivery-map.mjs indus-foods --check` / `--status` | the tracking file: flip each key you finish to `{ "done": "<commit>", "unit": "<unit>" }` or `{ "accepted": "<reason>", "unit": "<unit>" }` |
| `node scripts/computed-route/tools/mutate.mjs <route dir> <mutations.json> <test file>` | proving each MUST FAIL test turns red when its code is broken |
| Playwright MCP / Chrome DevTools MCP | live DOM and computed styles at 375/768/1440, and draft-and-live pairs (one browser at a time) |
| `ListAgents` + `SendMessage` | the serial queue before any build, deploy, reseed or calibration |

## Done when
Gate G-S in the plan: `capabilities.mjs --drafts` lists no Indus gap except accepted differences, the delivery map shows every key done or accepted, every surface paired, and Bean's sign-off.

Estimate: 1 h 30 agent time plus Bean's hour.

Guardrails (beyond CLAUDE.md): follow the plan's "Sessions" paragraph on shared resources (refresh-loop order B, C, D1, D2; reseed only from a clean `origin/main` worktree; edit only your own units' keys in `clone-coverage.json`, `data/coverage-test-baseline.json` and the delivery map, committing and rebasing after each unit). Every unit meets the plan's "closing standard" (shared mechanism, coverage entry with a test, MUST FAIL plus mutation red, reduced motion, commit named `feat(<unit>): …`). Clone what the draft does and add no safeguard it lacks; every preset control also takes a custom value (the plan's Rulings). Run the full route suite in the main checkout (`node --test "tests/*.test.mjs"` in `scripts/computed-route`); a worktree run fails 5 known lint and solve-held tests. `python scripts/check-no-client-names.py --check` before every commit. Agent worktrees need `npm ci` in `scripts/computed-route` first.

Delete this prompt file (`git rm`) in the session's closing commit.
