# Session Handoff — 2026-06-07 (CLONING thread) — bound-mode cheat PURGED + draft-centric fidelity verifier (parity2) built/rewired/QC'd

> Live handoff. Prior sessions: `.claude/memory/handoff-archive.md`. Next session: `.claude/next-session-prompt.md`. Theme thread shares `main` — commit by explicit path (`git commit -- <paths>`), `git log -1 --stat` before pushing.

## Completed This Session
1. **Task 1 (docs) DONE + pushed:** executed HIGH-6 — handoffs truncated→`memory/handoff-archive.md`, 9 superseded plans→`plans/archive/`, README/Spec18/06-BUILD-ORDER fixed, **decisions.md 843→526** (archived ≤D113). parking.md deliberately NOT force-shrunk (its 112 entries are all already active status). Commits `c5cb0313`/`707aa4e2`.
2. **Tasks 5/6 investigated → bound-blocked:** live page-8 data proved the trust-bar's gap/column defects are BOUND-MODE artefacts (badges = echoed draft CSS, not block attributes); ZERO page-8 containers hit the wrapper WIP's `grid_on_inner` path → 5/6 deliver no visible change while bound. Bean redirected to Task 3. Wrapper WIP (7 files) left UNCOMMITTED.
3. **Task 3 (bound purge) SHIPPED + live-verified (D182, commit `92bcf997`):** 6-persona `/adversarial-council` gate (NO-GO-as-written → must-fixes baked in) + Bean approval + content audit. Converter: deleted the `sourceMode='bound'` stamp + added a typed `items[]` handler (G3 path); seed `has_inner_blocks` 1→0 (the FATAL fix — drops trust-bar to G3, suppresses orphan child-walk). Block: typed-only (bound branch deleted, enum `['typed']` v0.5.0, edit.js stripped, save→null). Re-cloned page 8. **Live homepage: 4 native badges, 0 nested containers, 4-col grid, £35 correct. Regression PASS: page-589 configurator intact.** Icons DEFERRED (placeholder ticks, Bean-approved).
4. **Proved Bean right twice:** the purge fixed the trust-bar AND 2 product-cards (every sourceMode block), not just the trust-bar; and the hero is already a faithful native composite (the "dark-pink gradient" was a stale doc claim I wrongly repeated).
5. **Diagnosed all 3 fidelity tools as unreliable + WHY:** pixel-diff over-reports on photos/sub-pixel; old clone-parity rewards the DOM-mirror (penalises conversion); leftover-buckets conflates correct-absence with extraction-failure (the perfect trust-bar logged 48 false "failures"). stage-2 + extract.json ARE reliable.
6. **Fixed a silently-broken check (commit `29e82568`):** stage-4j wp-blocks-validate had skipped every run on a Windows cp1252 crash (`→`); forced UTF-8 → now validates.
7. **Built + rewired + QC'd parity2 (commits `2ddea70b`/`a2336198`/`486f8f9f`)** via `/dispatching-parallel-agents` + `/qc`. DRAFT = 100% denominator; measures CONTENT + LAYOUT + CSS transfer, fate-aware, class-AGNOSTIC (own-text anchors + LCA tree-alignment absorb renames + WP wrapper divs). `/qc` caught + fixed a content false-negative (→word-overlap). Bean's catch: layout was diluted → now a weighted first-class signal. **Trust-bar = content 100% / layout 95% / css 96% / full 93%** (honest; one badge flagged). Mirrored sections honestly low (brand layout 48%).
8. **Wired parity2 into `/sgs-clone` as Stage 11.5 (commit `553334f3`):** after Stage 10 deploy, captures draft+clone (golden rebuilt fresh from the mockup) + runs parity2 → per-section content/layout/css/full printed (sorted worst-layout-first) + `pipeline-state/<run>/parity2-report.json`. Soft-fail (`--no-parity2` opt-out). **Verified live on a real page-8 run** — numbers match standalone. Rule 4 (per-class transfer accounting) is now automatic on every clone.

## Current State
- **Branch:** `main` at `a7cfd07a`. Theme thread co-active.
- **Tests:** parity2 self-tests pass (3 fixtures incl. rename+wrapper LCA); converter imports clean. No project suite. Build passes.
- **Uncommitted (NOT this session's deliverables):** wrapper WIP (`container/edit.js`, `SpacingControl.js`, `class-sgs-container-wrapper.php`, `ContainerWrapperControls.js` — unfinished Tasks 5/6, Bean-aware); pre-existing noise (phase4-*.txt, theme-snapshot.json, lucide-icons.php).
- **Live:** trust-bar TYPED on page 8 (sandybrown homepage canary). `.parity-golden.json` rebuilt 1440-ONLY — regenerate 3 viewports with `--rebuild-golden --viewports 375,768,1440` when needed.

## Known Issues / Blockers
- parity2 minor limits (non-blocking): textless leaves (identical placeholder icons) can share a clone match; single-node sections show a binary full%; position-0 LCA can map the first badge to a container-ish node (one false DROPPED on the first trust-bar badge).
- The pipeline still **container-mirrors 5 of 9 sections** (featured-product/brand/ingredients/gift/social-proof → `sgs/container` @conf 0.0) — converter Method-2 CSS-lift is the big remaining fidelity work (separate from the bound purge; parity2's layout% now measures it).

## Next Priorities (in order)
1. **Icon-identity resolver** — placeholder ticks → real icons (multi-library SVG fingerprint + emoji reverse-index + confidence + visible fallback).
2. **Converter Method-2 CSS-lift** for the 5 mirrored sections (the real visible-fidelity lever; parity2 Stage 11.5 now measures pre/post automatically — use its per-section `css_dropped`/`layout_dropped` as the spec).
3. **Finish + commit OR revert the wrapper WIP** (old Tasks 5/6) — don't leave it dangling.
4. (Done this session: parity2 built + wired into `/sgs-clone` Stage 11.5.)

## Notes for Next Session
- **bound-mode is a TEST CHEAT** (echoes draft DOM as `$content`) — purged from trust-bar; only the LIVE WC configurator (`sourceMode='wc-product'/'sgs-cpt'`, page 589) is a legit non-typed mode. Never re-introduce a converter `bound` emit.
- **parity2: trust CONTENT% + LAYOUT%** (validated on trust-bar). It measures TRANSFER fidelity, not nativeness — the anti-mirror gate (R-22-15) detects the cheat; parity2 measures how much carried over.
- The converter routes `.sgs-trust-bar` correctly to `sgs/trust-bar`; the OTHER 5 sections → `sgs/container` is Method-2 work, not a routing bug.
- Don't trust leftover-buckets' `extraction_failed` count as "what failed" — it conflates correct-absences; parity2 replaces it as the fidelity signal.
