title: "Clone-fix SIGN-OFF LEDGER — every issue → family → status → workstream"
created: 2026-06-09
status: Stage 0 baseline (CLONE-FIX-BUILD-PLAN.md). The authoritative close-out tracker. Re-baselined against git+canary per council C5. Update the Status column as each issue is verified fixed on the real homepage (R-22-11/R-22-13). Nothing is "done" until its row reads VERIFIED.
legend: "Family: F1 per-slot CSS routing · F1b array per-item · F2 font-family · F3 block-render default · F4 breakpoint · F5 block resolution/capability · F6a inheritance/ancestor · F7 double-emission · F8 content extraction · NEW framework/draft. Status: OPEN · SHIPPED (already fixed) · VERIFIED (fixed+live-confirmed)."

# Sign-off ledger

## Status summary (RE-BASELINED 2026-06-12 against live page-8 DOM)

**⚠ The "F1 padding routing" framing was a MISDIAGNOSIS.** Section padding renders correctly at every breakpoint (live-verified). Full re-baseline: [`../reports/2026-06-12-ledger-rebaseline-live-dom.md`](../reports/2026-06-12-ledger-rebaseline-live-dom.md). Captures: `pipeline-state/rebaseline-2026-06-12/live-capture-{1440,768,375}.json`.

- Total tracked: **55 issues**.
- **SHIPPED (pre-programme):** H-C2 (D192), FP-F (D191), FP-E/FP-H (D204), SP-G binding-half (D191).
- **VERIFIED (live-confirmed):** prior 8 (H-B + GF-B.1/B.3/B.4/D.1/G/H/I) **+ 12 newly-closed on the 2026-06-12 re-baseline** — H-A, H-A2, FP-A, FP-B, FP-C, FP-G, FP-J, FP-L1, BR-A, IN-A, GF-A, SP-D.2.
- **STILL-BROKEN (live-evidenced, clustered into 8 fix-patterns P1–P8):** ~22 — none are section-padding. P1 margin-bottom transfer (IN-B/GF-C/SP-B/GF-E), P2 Fraunces font (FP-M/GF-E/F), P3 inner max-width (IN-B/H-C1), P4 border-radius (GF-D.2), P5 render-defaults (BR-C/SP-F/TB-A/B/FP-I/N/O/P/IN-C), P6 text-align (IN-E/GF-B.2), P7 content/icon extraction (IN-D/IN-F; BR-B = media-sideload NOT converter), P8 testimonial typography (SP-D.1/SP-E).
- **DESIGN/SPEC DECISION (not converter fidelity rows):** FP-D, FP-K, FP-DRAFT, TB-C, TB-C-draft, SP-A, SP-C, SP-G.

## Workstream load (open issues only)
- **Stage 1 (F1 cross-node + F6a):** ~18 (the biggest — H-B, FP-B/C/J/N/P, GF-B.1/B.2/C/G, SP-B/D.2, IN-B + F6a: H-C1, FP-A/K, IN-A/E/F, GF-A/E)
- **Stage 1b (array per-item):** 2 (TB-A, TB-B) — small count, but the FR-22-2.5 build is medium.
- **Stage 2-F3:** ~15 (the second-biggest — BR-C, FP-G/I/L1/N/O, IN-C, GF-D.1/D.2/H, SP-C/D.1/E/F + F6b half of FP-A/GF-A/GF-E)
- **Stage 2-F4:** 4 (H-A2, BR-A, GF-B.3, SP-A)
- **Stage 2-F2:** 3 (FP-M, GF-B.4, GF-F)
- **Stage 2-F5:** 3 (FP-D, SP-G, GF-I-half)
- **Stage 2-F7:** 1 (H-A)
- **Stage 2-F8:** ~4 (BR-B, IN-D, IN-F, GF-I-half, SP-E-half)
- **NEW / draft / Spec 27:** TB-C, TB-C-draft, FP-E, FP-H, FP-DRAFT. **⚠ MILESTONE GATE (qc-council):** FP-E (card-grid WooCommerce product capability) + FP-H (product-card built-in-elements architecture) are NOT Stage-1/2/3 work — they are a **Spec 27 block-build milestone** (multi-session: new attrs + render.php + edit.js + deprecated.js + WC query, co-ordinated with Spec 27 Phases). They **cannot be marked VERIFIED by the clone-fix waves** — they require an explicit Spec-27 session. **SEQUENCING (Bean-confirmed 2026-06-09): that session must run AFTER (a) the Spec27-28 council-mustfix wave plan (`.claude/plans/2026-06-06-spec27-28-council-mustfix-wave-plan.md`, currently AWAITING-BEAN-SIGNOFF / Wave-2 mid-build — it edits the same product-card files) AND (b) the cloning converter Stage 1.** Prompt ready at `.claude/reports/wave2/FP-E-FP-H-SPEC27-REBUILD-PROMPT.md`. Until then, FP-E/FP-H stay OPEN by design; the 55-row ledger reaching all-VERIFIED is gated on it. Do NOT let them be silently rolled into "residue".

## Stage-1 build prerequisites (council C5 — must be green BEFORE the relevant commit)
- **canonical_slot backfill — NOT A GATE (D194); DONE as metadata.** The cross-node dispatch does NOT find the parent's per-slot box attrs by `canonical_slot` — structural box CSS routes NAME-FREE via layer-prefix + `property_suffixes` (D194). F1-cross-node has **no dependency** on this backfill. The ~41 content-area rows (`contentWidth`/`contentPadding*`) are tagged `canonical_slot='content'` + `role='layout'` as convention-consistent metadata only, maintained deterministically by `/sgs-update` Stage 1 `assign-canonical.py` (the throwaway `seed-canonical-slots.py` was deleted as redundant parallel infra). Status: **DONE-as-metadata, not a pre-commit gate.** Design-gate: `WRAPPER-CSS-ROUTING-DESIGN-GATE.md`.
- **Gate identity (no doc may say `is_class_section_block` for the composite-interior carve-out).** The live gates are `db.has_scalar_media_attrs(slug)` (`convert.py:2940`) + `_is_container_mirror_block` (`:2950`); the XS-3 guard is `fold_eligible` (`_process_container_children:3857`). Corrected across all docs 2026-06-09.

## Uncaptured residue (council Completeness — must stay visible)
- **Mobile/tablet defects** — the source review was DESKTOP-ONLY. The responsiveness *failure-mode* is captured (F4 + per-device CSS vars), and universal fixes apply to all devices — but the **375/768 verification pass at Stage 3 may surface device-specific defects** not in this ledger. Add them here when found.
- **FP-F drift guard** — the binding fix shipped, but its `generate-extension-attributes.js --check` is only wired to prebuild, not CI/pre-commit. Confirm the pre-commit wiring (memory `dont-claim-a-guard-is-enforced-unless-wired`).
- Any new issue found during build/verify gets a row here — the ledger is the single close-out source.
- ~~**NEW 2026-06-11 (re-clone ledger walk):** **testimonial slides render EMPTY on live page 8**~~ → **RESOLVED 2026-06-12** (commits `3938a7b0` converter + `09a908fd` block-side, on main). Root cause was NOT InnerBlocks-not-rendering — it was `block_composition.has_inner_blocks=1` STALE after the D8 typed rebuild, so the converter emitted child blocks the typed render.php ignores. Fixed via the universal DB-driven scalar-lift (quote/name/stars → typed attrs, opt-in gated). **LIVE-VERIFIED on re-cloned page 8:** 3 cards, quote+name visible + 5 SVG stars (aria 5/5) at 1440/768/~500 + card chrome faithful. Reports: `reports/visual-diff/testimonial-2026-06-12.md`. **SP-C/D.1/D.2/E are now UNBLOCKED (measurable) but stay OPEN** — they are distinct fidelity rows (verticalAlign / star-size / F8) not yet measured against the draft. **⚠ SP-D.1/D.2 fix-shape SUPERSEDED:** stars now render from the `ratingStars` typed attr (5 SVGs), NOT a child `sgs/star-rating` block, so the "route font-size → child star-rating size attr" route no longer applies — star size is now a testimonial-block CSS/attr question; re-scope before measuring.
- **NEW 2026-06-11 (re-clone ledger walk):** **parity tooling has a BEM-class blind spot for converted output.** `clone-parity.js` matches elements by draft BEM class (`sgs-hero__content` etc.), but the converter correctly emits NATIVE SGS blocks (Rule 1: convert-don't-mirror), which do NOT carry those draft classes — so the differ reports them "ELEMENT MISSING" and the aggregate score is junk (`1/130`). `parity2/` (content-transfer by abstract node) is the more honest aggregate but mis-matches some nodes. **Per-row acceptance must use targeted live-DOM probes on the rendered SGS-block elements, not the BEM-class differ.** Also live-confirmed: a **global base-font drift (16→18px)** on the clone inflates every text element's fontSize/lineHeight failure — a theme/global-styles-layer issue, NOT any converter row; root-cause at the theme layer.
