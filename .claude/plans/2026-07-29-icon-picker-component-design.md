**Captured:** 2026-05-08 (during sgs/icon-list expansion review)

**What:** Every SGS block that exposes an icon picker control hardcodes its own ~8-item dropdown. Meanwhile the framework actually supports a much richer icon universe: **Lucide (1,963 SVG icons)** + **emojis treated as icons** (uimax `icon_libraries` has 12 emoji families flagged `is_emoji=1` with full Rosetta Stone equivalents) + any **other icon sets installed** (Heroicons, Phosphor, Tabler, Font Awesome — registerable via a future `sgs_register_icon_set` hook). Operators editing `sgs/icon-list`, `sgs/icon`, `sgs/icon-block`, `sgs/info-box`, `sgs/process-steps`, `sgs/multi-button`, `sgs/whatsapp-cta`, `sgs/notice-banner`, `sgs/trust-bar`, etc. all see different tiny dropdowns and never reach any of the broader universe.

**Why this matters strategically:** every clone we do that uses an icon-rich design (services pages, feature grids, process steps, food/restaurant menus) currently risks the operator picking "the closest of 8" instead of "the right icon out of thousands". Recogniser quality also suffers — it can't propose accurate icon mappings if the editor can't render them. Branded emoji-as-marker is a real client request (food sites, lifestyle brands, kids/education sites) that SGS structurally supports today but no operator can actually reach via the UI.

**Spec — universal `<IconPicker>` component (NOT lucide-specific):**

1. **New shared component:** `plugins/sgs-blocks/src/components/IconPicker.js`
   - **Source-agnostic interface** — accepts a `value` shaped as `{ source: 'lucide' | 'emoji' | 'heroicons' | '<custom>', value: '<icon-id-or-glyph>' }` and emits the same shape via `onChange`
   - **Source switcher tabs** at top: Lucide / Emoji / [other registered sets] / Recent / Favourites
   - **Search field** (debounced ~150ms) — searches across the active source by name + tag list. Cross-source search optional (toggle: "Search all sources").
   - **Virtual-scrolling grid** (`react-window` or equivalent) — only renders visible cells. Critical for Lucide (1,963 icons) and the emoji set (~3,500 standard Unicode emojis).
   - **Category sidebar per source:**
     - Lucide: commerce / food / transport / nature / interface / arrows / weather / health / etc.
     - Emoji: smileys / animals / food / activities / travel / objects / symbols / flags
     - Other sets: whatever taxonomy the set declares
   - **Favourites** — pinned icons saved per-site in `wp_options` (max 36, mixed sources).
   - **Recently used** — last 16 used in this editor session (sessionStorage).
   - **Selected preview** at the top with the source label so operator knows what's picked.
   - **Keyboard navigation** (arrow keys + Enter) and 44×44 touch targets per WCAG.

2. **Icon-set registry** (PHP + JS):
   - PHP-side: `sgs_register_icon_set( $args )` — params: `slug`, `label`, `icons` (array of `{id, name, tags, category, svg_or_glyph}`), `kind` (`'svg'` / `'emoji'` / `'font-icon'`)
   - JS-side: `wp.hooks.applyFilters('sgs.icon-picker.sources', defaultSources)` — third-party plugins can extend
   - Built-in registrations:
     - `lucide` (kind=svg) — sourced from existing `includes/lucide-icons.php` (regenerated with tag/category metadata if missing)
     - `emoji-keycap`, `emoji-people`, `emoji-food`, etc. (12 families, kind=emoji) — sourced from uimax `icon_libraries WHERE is_emoji=1`
     - Future: heroicons / phosphor / tabler — opt-in installs

3. **Render-side handling** — the `value` shape carries `source` so the renderer knows whether to:
   - For `source: 'lucide'` → output inline SVG via `sgs_get_lucide_icon()` (existing path)
   - For `source: 'emoji'` → output the glyph directly (needs `aria-label` from the icon's name for screen readers)
   - For `source: '<custom>'` → look up the registered renderer for that set

   Render helper: new `sgs_render_icon( $value )` in `includes/render-helpers.php` that switches on source and returns the right HTML.

4. **Migration path** — every block currently exposing an icon-picker control:
   - `sgs/icon-list` (single icon + per-item icon + pattern entries)
   - `sgs/icon`
   - `sgs/icon-block`
   - `sgs/info-box`
   - `sgs/process-steps`
   - `sgs/multi-button` (icon-before-label / icon-after-label)
   - `sgs/whatsapp-cta` (icon override)
   - `sgs/notice-banner` (state icon)
   - `sgs/trust-bar` (per-item icon)
   - `sgs/social-icons` (already partially solves this for social platforms — keep as-is OR fold in)
   - any block that hardcodes its own icon dropdown

   Replace each block's bespoke dropdown with `<IconPicker value={...} onChange={...} />`. **Schema change:** existing string-typed icon attributes (e.g. `icon: 'check'`) need migration to the object shape (`{ source: 'lucide', value: 'check' }`). Each migration carries a deprecation that maps old string values to the lucide source. ~15-20 min per block including build verification + deprecation.

5. **Lucide registry expansion** — `includes/lucide-icons.php` is auto-generated. If the current file doesn't carry tag/category metadata, regenerate with metadata included. Confirm the generator script during work.

6. **Emoji registry** — already in uimax. Build a one-time importer that pulls `uimax.icon_libraries WHERE is_emoji=1` plus the standard Unicode emoji set into a JSON manifest at `includes/emoji-icons.json` for the picker to consume offline.

7. **Performance budget** — virtual-scrolling means only rendered cells eat DOM. The full Lucide SVG payload should NOT be loaded on editor mount; lazy-fetch chunks (e.g. by category) on demand. Emoji glyphs are essentially free (single Unicode characters). Render `<svg>` inline only for visible Lucide cells (~20-40 × ~1KB each = ~30KB DOM at any time).

**Effort:** ~3-4 hrs for the shared component + source-registry + emoji import + Lucide metadata regen. ~15-20 minutes per migrated block × ~10 blocks = ~3-4 hrs migration including deprecations. Total **~6-8 hrs realistic** (revised up from initial 4-6 estimate to reflect the broader scope).

**Note (schema-change caveat):** the project's current no-version-bumps/no-deprecations pre-production policy (D270/D271, blub.db `no-version-bumps-or-deprecations-preproduction`) POSTDATES this spec (2026-05-08) and BANS `deprecated.js`. Migration path item 4 above (which proposes a deprecation per block) will need re-scoping against that policy when this is picked up — do not build the deprecation-based migration as written without checking current policy first.
